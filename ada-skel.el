;;; ada-skel.el --- Extension to Ada mode for inserting statement skeletons  -*- lexical-binding:t -*-

;;; Design:
;;
;; The primary user command is `wisi-skel-expand', which inserts the
;; skeleton associated with the previous word (possibly skipping a
;; name).
;;
;; We don't define skeletons that prompt for most of the content; it
;; is easier just to type in the buffer.
;;
;; These skeletons are not intended to teach a novice the language,
;; just to make it easier to write code that the wisi parser
;; handles without error, and handle repeated names nicely.

;;; History:

;; Created May 1987.
;; Original version from V. Bowman as in ada.el of Emacs-18
;; (borrowed heavily from Mick Jordan's Modula-2 package for GNU,
;; as modified by Peter Robinson, Michael Schmidt, and Tom Perrine.)
;;
;; Sep 1993. Daniel Pfeiffer <pfeiffer@cict.fr> (DP)
;; Introduced statement.el for smaller code and user configurability.
;;
;; Nov 1993. Rolf Ebert <ebert@enpc.fr> (RE) Moved the
;; skeleton generation into this separate file. The code still is
;; essentially written by DP
;;
;; Adapted Jun 1994. Markus Heritsch
;; <Markus.Heritsch@studbox.uni-stuttgart.de> (MH)
;; added menu bar support for templates
;;
;; 1994/12/02  Christian Egli <cegli@hcsd.hac.com>
;; General cleanup and bug fixes.
;;
;; 1995/12/20  John Hutchison <hutchiso@epi.syr.ge.com>
;; made it work with skeleton.el from Emacs-19.30. Several
;; enhancements and bug fixes.
;;
;; Sep 2013 Stephen Leake renamed to ada-skel (to match skeleton.el),
;; complete re-write: added ada-skel-alist (to get some of the
;; functionality of the sadly missed Else package). Simplified
;; skeletons; just make it easier to work with the ada-wisi parser,
;; don't try to teach syntax.
