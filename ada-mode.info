1 Overview
**********

The Emacs mode for programming in Ada helps the user in reading existing
code and facilitates developing new code.

   Cross-reference information output by the compiler is used to provide
powerful code navigation (jump to definition, find all uses, etc).

   When you open a file with a file extension of '.ads' or '.adb', Emacs
will automatically load and activate Ada mode.

   Ada mode works without any customization, if you are using the GNAT
compiler (<https://libre.adacore.com/>) and the GNAT default naming
convention.

   You must customize a few things if you are using a different file
naming convention or compiler; *Note Non-standard file names::, *Note
Other compiler::.

   In addition, you may want to customize the indentation,
capitalization, and other things; *Note Other customization::.

   Finally, for large Ada projects, you will want to set up an Emacs Ada
mode project file for each project; *Note Project files::.  Note that
these are different from the GNAT project files used by the GNAT tools.

   *Note Debuggers: (emacs)Debuggers, for general information on
debugging.

* Why not LSP?::


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Why not LSP?,  Up: Overview

1.1 Why not LSP?
================

The Language Server Protocol (LSP, <https://langserver.org>) supports an
external language parser, as Ada mode does, and it is supported by the
GNU ELPA package eglot.  Ada mode does not use LSP mostly for historical
reasons; the Ada mode parser was first developed before LSP was started.
In addition, LSP does not support some of the navigation information
provided by the Ada mode parser (although that could be provided as a
custom command).

   We may investigate supporting an LSP parser in the future.  In
particular, the AdaCore Gnat Studio editor uses an LSP parser for
several functions; Emacs Ada mode could use that as a backend if it
supports LSP.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Customization,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Top

2 Installation
**************

Ada mode requires Emacs 25.0 or greater.  Compiling the Ada code for the
external process parser requires GNAT GPL 2017 or later; tested with
GNAT Community Edition 2019 and GNAT Pro 19.

   Ada mode is distributed in the Gnu ELPA package archive; it can be
installed via 'M-x list-packages' (*note (emacs)Packages::).  Note that
it requires the 'wisi' and 'uniquify-files' packages as dependencies.

   In Emacs < 27 you must first enable packages in your '~/.emacs',
_after_ customizing 'Info-default-directory-list' (if you do that):

     (package-initialize)

   To see what version of Ada mode you have installed, invoke 'M-x
ada-mode-version'.

   You must also install the associated Ada executables (for the
language parser).  You may want to install the Ada Reference Manual.

* Menu:

* Ada Reference Manual::
* Ada executables::


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Ada Reference Manual,  Next: Ada executables,  Up: Installation

2.1 Ada Reference Manual
========================

The ELPA package ada-ref-man includes the Ada Reference Manual and
Annotated Ada Reference Manual in info format.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Ada executables,  Prev: Ada Reference Manual,  Up: Installation

2.2 Ada executables
===================

Ada mode requires the external parser, which must be compiled.

   Ada mode has support for an external cross reference tool
'gpr_query', which uses compiler-generated information.  In the case of
Ada, the necessary '.ali' files are automatically generated by the
standard compilation process.  For other languages, e.g.  C, C++, '.gli'
files can be generated using the compiler switch '-fdump-xref'.
'-fdump-xref' is an AdaCore extension, not available in FSF GCC.

   'gpr_query' is an Ada program, which is distributed as source and
must be built.  Its source code is in the 'ada-mode' Gnu ELPA package.

   'gpr_query' is similar to the AdaCore utility 'gnatxref', but
supports additional queries.

   Both the parser and 'gpr_query' require the 'GNATCOLL' library
provided by AdaCore, distributed with GNAT GPL 2017 or later, and also
available at Github (<https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoll>).  The notes
below assume that the compiler is installed at '$prefix', e.g.
'/usr/local/gnat-2019', and that '$prefix/bin' is first on the 'PATH'.
If you are running Windows, use mingw64 'bash' to run these commands.

   On linux, some versions of the 'GNATCOLL.iconv' package (used by
'gpr_query', but not the parser) explicitly require the 'libiconv.so'
library.  GNAT provides the 'libiconv.so' library in
'<gnat>/lib64/libiconv.so'.  On Debian, that directory is not in the
standard load path, and iconv is provided by glibc, so 'libiconv.so' is
not found on the standard load path.  So you must set LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
but only when running 'gpr-query':

     (setq gpr-query-env '("LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Projects/gnat/pro_19.2/lib64")

   In general, 'gpr_query' should be compiled with the compiler version
that is used to generate the user project '.ali' files; the 'ali' file
format can change with each compiler version.  'gpr_query' creates a
database of cross reference information; that database must be deleted
if the compiler version changes, to force a complete rebuild.

   The default binary gnatcoll distributed with GNAT GPL 2019 does not
include the xref package, which is required by 'gpr_query'.  So we must
build gnatcoll xref from sources.

* Building the executables::


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Building GNATCOLL,  Next: Building the executables,  Up: Ada executables

2.2.1 Building GNATCOLL
-----------------------

Download gnatcoll-db from <https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoll-db>;
select the latest release branch (or the one that matches your
compiler), click on the "clone or download" button, select "Download
ZIP".

   Similarly, download gnatcoll-bindings from
<https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoll-bindings/tree/20.2> (for
gnatcoll-iconv).

   Then unpack, build, and install the required components:

     tar xf ~/Downloads/gnatcoll-bindings-20.2.zip
     cd gnatcoll-bindings-20.2
     cd iconv
     ./setup.py build
     ./setup.py install

     tar xf ~/Downloads/gnatcoll-db-20.2.zip
     cd gnatcoll-db-20.2
     make -C sql
     make -C sql install
     make -C sqlite
     make -C sqlite install
     make -C xref
     make -C xref install


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Building the executables,  Prev: Building GNATCOLL,  Up: Ada executables

2.2.2 Building the executables
------------------------------

'gpr_query' requires the 'pthread' library.  On Windows, this is
available in Mingw64 as package
'mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-winpthreads-git'.

   To build and install 'gpr_query' and the parser, assuming the
'ada-mode-6.0.xx' GNU ELPA package is installed:

     cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ada-mode-6.0.xx
     ./build.sh
     ./install.sh

   By default, 'install.sh' installs the executables in the same
directory as the GNAT executable (using 'gprinstall').  If you don't
have write privileges there, or if you want to install somewhere else,
use 'install.sh --prefix=<dir>'.

   'ada-mode' will use 'gpr_query' and the parser if they are found in
'PATH'.

3 Customizing Ada mode
**********************

Here we assume you are familiar with setting variables in Emacs, either
thru 'customize' or in elisp (in your '.emacs' file).  For a basic
introduction to customize, elisp, and Emacs in general, see the tutorial
('C-h t').

* Menu:

* Slow response::
* Non-standard file names::
* Other compiler::
* Other cross-reference::
* Other customization::


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Slow response,  Next: Non-standard file names,  Up: Customization

3.1 Slow response
=================

In large files, parsing takes a noticable amount of time, so it gets in
the way of interactive typing due to immediate fontification triggering
a parse.

   There are three ways to deal with this:

  1. Set 'wisi-partial-parse-threshold' In your '~./emacs':

          (setq wisi-partial-parse-threshold 100001)

     The default value (100001) may already be appropriate; it depends
     on how fast your machine is, and what your tolerance for slow
     response is.

     Files larger than 'wisi-partial-parse-threshold' (in characters)
     will be parsed partially; only the part of the buffer needed for
     the current task will be parsed.  For fontification, that is the
     visible part.  For indent, it is approximately the current
     subprogram or package.  For navigation, it is always the entire
     file, which will still be slow; that is the only way to ensure
     useful results.

     With this setting, indentation may not be correct; the Ada menu
     entry "Edit | Indent containing statement" will indent correctly.

  2. Delay fontification by setting 'jit-lock-defer-time' in your
     '~./emacs':

          (setq jit-lock-defer-time 1.5)

     This is a global setting; it affects all buffers.  Fontification
     will only be performed after you have stopped typing for the
     indicated number of seconds.

  3. Turn off parsing for fontification by setting 'wisi-disable-face'
     in your '~./emacs'

          (setq wisi-disable-face t)

     This turns of fontification for type, package, and function names;
     only Ada reserved words are fontified.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Non-standard file names,  Next: Other compiler,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Customization

3.2 Non-standard file names
===========================

By default, Ada mode is configured to use the GNAT file naming
convention, where file names are a simple modification of the Ada names,
and the extension for specs and bodies are '.ads' and '.adb',
respectively.

   Emacs uses the file extension to enable Ada mode; Ada mode uses the
file extentions to allow moving from a package body to the corresponding
spec and back.

   Emacs and Ada mode support ways to use alternative file extensions
for specs and bodies.  Note that you must also tell the compiler about
these extensions in a GNAT project file Naming package; doing that is
beyond the scope of this manual.

   For instance, if your spec and bodies files are called 'UNIT_s.ada'
and 'UNIT_b.ada', respectively, you can add the following to your
'.emacs' file:

     ;; Tell Ada mode about spec and body extensions
     (ada-add-extensions "_s.ada" "_b.ada")

     ;; Tell Emacs to use Ada mode for those extensions
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ada\\'" . ada-mode))

   You can define additional extensions:

     (ada-add-extensions ".ads" "_b.ada")
     (ada-add-extensions ".ads" ".body")

   This means that whenever Ada mode looks for the body for a file whose
extension is '.ads', it will take the first available file that ends
with either '.adb', '_b.ada' or '.body'.

   Simililarly, if Ada mode is looking for a spec, it will look for
'.ads' or '_s.ada'.

   If the filename excluding the extension is not derived from the Ada
name following the GNAT convention, you need to provide an alternate
function for 'ada-file-name-from-ada-name'.  Doing that is beyond the
scope of this manual; see the current definitions in 'ada-mode.el' and
'ada-gnat-xref.el' for examples.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Other compiler,  Next: Other cross-reference,  Prev: Non-standard file names,  Up: Customization

3.3 Other compiler
==================

The wisi project variable 'ada_compoiler' (default elisp variable
'ada-compiler') (default ''gnat') controls dispatching in
compiler-specific functions for corresponding Ada mode operations.

   To use a compiler other than GNAT, you must write Emacs lisp code
that provides the interface to the compiler, and set 'ada-compiler' and
the indirection variables.

   See 'ada-compiler-gnat.el' for an example.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Other cross-reference,  Next: Other customization,  Prev: Other compiler,  Up: Customization

3.4 Other cross-reference
=========================

The wisi project variable 'xref_tool' (default elisp variable
'ada-xref-tool') controls dispatching in the
cross-reference-tool-specific functions for corresponding Ada mode
operations.

   If 'gpr_query' is found in 'PATH', the default cross-reference tool
is 'gpr_query'; otherwise it is 'gnatxref'.

   To use a cross reference tool other than the above, you must write
Emacs lisp code that provides the interface to the tool, and set
'ada-xref-tool' and the indirection variables.

   See 'ada-gnat-xref.el' and 'gpr-query.el' for examples.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Other customization,  Prev: Other cross-reference,  Up: Customization

3.5 Other customization
=======================

All user-settable Ada mode variables can be set via the menu 'Ada |
Customize'; some can also be set in wisi project files (*note Project
files::).

   To modify a specific variable, you can directly call the function
'customize-variable'; just type 'M-x customize-variable <RET>
VARIABLE-NAME <RET>'.

   Alternately, you can specify variable settings in the Emacs
configuration file, '~/.emacs'.  This file is coded in Emacs lisp, and
the syntax to set a variable is the following:

     (setq variable-name value)

   Some general Emacs settings that are useful for Ada files:

'context menu'
     By default, the context menu is bound to <C-down-mouse-3>, i.e.
     control-right-click.  <down-mouse-3> is already bound in the global
     map; you can override that global binding in the 'ada-mode-hook'
     (see below for code).
'other-frame-window-mode'
     Ada mode does not provide any 'other-frame' or 'other-window'
     variants of user operations.  Instead, it is recommended to use the
     Gnu ELPA package 'other-frame-window'.
'delete-trailing-whitespace'
     Deletes space, tab at end of line and blank lines at end of buffer.
'xref configuration'
     'xref-prompt-for-identifier'
          Set to 'nil' to be prompted less when finding definitions or
          references.
     'xref-show-xrefs-function'
          Determine placement of the window where references are shown.
     'xref-show-definitions-function'
          Determine placement of the window where definitions are shown.
     'xref--transient-buffer-mode-map'
          keymap used in some xref windows; you may want to disable the
          <RET> binding there.
'untabify'
     Deletes tab characters that have crept into the file.
'indent-tabs-mode'
     Don't insert tab characters when indenting.
'copyright-update'
     Updates the copyright date in the file header comment, to the
     current year.
'electric-pair-mode'
     Insert a matching right paren when you type a left paren.
'hippie-expand'
     Bind 'hippie-expand' to a key; it expands the word before point,
     using words from current buffer, other buffers, file names, etc;
     see 'hippie-expand-try-functions-list'.  You can also add
     'wisi-skel-hippie-try' to that list.  Note that 'wisi-skel-expand'
     is bound to <C-c C-e> (*note Statement skeletons::).
'imenu'
     Navigate to subprograms and types by name, from a minibuffer menu.
'speedbar'
     Navigate to subprograms and types by name, from a list in a
     dedicated window.
'which-func'
     Display the current subprogram name in the mode bar.

   The above can all be set by the following code in your '~/.emacs'.
Note that some are functions are added to 'before-save-hook'; they run
just before a buffer is written to disk.  Also, the order is important;
ada-mode does not set up the Ada-specific features of imenu and speedbar
unless imenu is loaded first.

     (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
     (define-key xref--transient-buffer-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'xref-goto-xref)
     (setq xref-prompt-for-identifier nil) ;; only prompt on C-u
     (setq xref-show-xrefs-function #'xref--show-defs-buffer-at-bottom)
     (setq xref-show-definitions-function #'xref--show-defs-buffer-at-bottom)

     (electric-pair-mode 1)
     (require 'imenu) ;; also enables speedbar
     (require 'ada-mode)
     (add-to-list 'hippie-expand-try-functions-list 'wisi-skel-hippie-try)
     (define-key ada-mode-map "\C-e"     'hippie-expand)
     (define-key ada-mode-map [down-mouse-3] 'ada-popup-menu)
     (add-hook 'ada-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace nil t)
         (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'copyright-update nil t)
         (add-hook 'before-save-hook
                   (lambda () (untabify (point-min) (point-max)))
                    nil t)))

4 Compiling Executing
*********************

Ada projects can be compiled, linked, and executed using commands on the
Ada menu.  All of these commands can be customized via a project file
(*note Project files::), but the defaults are sufficient for using the
GNAT compiler for simple projects (single files, or several files in a
single directory).

   For complex projects, you will want to use 'make' or some other build
tool; in that case, you may need a wisi project file to tell Emacs about
the project directory tree and other settings.

* Menu:

* Compile commands::
* Compiling Examples::
* Compiler errors::


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Compile commands,  Next: Compiling Examples,  Prev: Compiling Executing,  Up: Compiling Executing

4.1 Compile commands
====================

Here are the commands for building an Ada project and running the main
program; they are all on the 'Ada | Build' menu.

   In multi-file projects, there must be one file that is the main
program.  That is given by the 'main' project file variable; it defaults
to the current file if not yet set, but is also set by the "set main and
build" command.

'Check file'
     Compiles the current file in syntax check mode, by running
     'check_cmd' defined in the current project file.  This typically
     runs faster than full compile mode, speeding up finding and fixing
     compilation errors.

     This sets 'main' only if it has not been set yet.

'Compile file'
     Compiles the current file, by running 'comp_cmd' from the current
     project file.

     This does not set 'main'.

'Set main and Build'
     Sets 'main' to the current file, then executes the Build command.

'Show main'
     Displays 'main' in the message buffer.

'Build'
     Compiles all obsolete units of the current 'main', and links
     'main', by running 'make_cmd' from the current project.

     This sets 'main' only if it has not been set yet.

'Run'
     Executes the main program in a shell, displayed in a separate Emacs
     buffer.  This runs 'run_cmd' from the current project.  The
     execution buffer allows for interactive input/output.

     To modify the run command, in particular to provide or change the
     command line arguments, type 'C-u' before invoking the command.

     This command is not available for a cross-compilation toolchain.

   It is important when using these commands to understand how 'main' is
used and changed.

   Build runs 'gprbuild' on the main unit.  During a typical
edit/compile session, this is the only command you need to invoke, which
is why it is bound to 'C-c C-c'.  It will compile all files needed by
the main unit, and display compilation errors in any of them.

   Note that Build can be invoked from any Ada buffer; typically you
will be fixing errors in files other than the main, but you don't have
to switch back to the main to invoke the compiler again.

   Novices and students typically work on single-file Ada projects.  In
this case, 'C-c C-m' will normally be the only command needed; it will
build the current file, rather than the last-built main.

   There are two ways to change 'main':

  1. Invoke 'Ada | Set main and Build', which sets 'main' to the current
     file.

  2. Invoke 'Ada | Project | Load', and load a project file that
     specifies 'main'

4.2 Compiling Examples
======================

We present several small projects, and walk thru the process of
compiling, linking, and running them.

   The first example illustrates more Ada mode features than the others;
you should work thru that example before doing the others.

   All of these examples assume you are using GNAT.

   The source for these examples is available on the Emacs Ada mode
website mentioned in *Note Installation::.

File: ada-mode.info,  Node: No project files,  Next: Set compiler options,  Prev: Compiling Examples,  Up: Compiling Examples

4.2.1 No project files
----------------------

This example uses no project files.

   First, create a directory 'Example_1', containing:

   'hello.adb':

     with Ada.Text_Io;
     procedure Hello
     is begin
        Put_Line("Hello from hello.adb");
     end Hello;

   Yes, this is missing "use Ada.Text_Io;" - we want to demonstrate
compiler error handling.

   'hello_2.adb' has no errors:

     with Hello_Pkg;
     procedure Hello_2
     is begin
        Hello_Pkg.Say_Hello;
     end Hello_2;

   'hello_pkg.ads' has no errors:

     package Hello_Pkg is
        procedure Say_Hello;
     end Hello_Pkg;

   'hello_pkg.adb':

     with Ada.Text_Io;
     package Hello_Pkg is
        procedure Say_Hello
        is begin
           Ada.Text_Io.Put_Line ("Hello from hello_pkg.adb");
        end Say_Hello;
     end Hello_Pkg;

   Yes, this is missing the keyword 'body'; another compiler error
example.  However, note that the indentation engine parser accepts this
code, making it possible to indent illegal Ada code.

   In buffer 'hello.adb', invoke the menu entry 'Ada | Build | Check
syntax'.  You should get a '*compilation*' buffer containing something
like (the directory paths will be different):

     -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "c:/Projects/org.emacs.ada-mode.stephe-1/test/Example_1/" -*-
     Compilation started at Fri Oct 18 04:23:54

     using project file D:\Apps\GNAT-gpl_2019\share\gpr\_default.gpr

     gprbuild: *** compilation phase failed

     Compilation exited abnormally with code 4 at Fri Oct 18 04:23:54

   The lines with actual errors (starting with 'hello.adb') are
highlighted, with the file name in red.

   Now invoke 'Ada | Build | Next compilation error'.  Or you can click
the middle mouse button on the first error line, or use the key binding
shown on the menu.  In the compilation buffer, a triangle is placed in
the left fringe on the first error line, and point is put at the place
of the error in the 'hello.adb' buffer.

   To fix the error, invoke 'Ada | Build | Fix compilation error'; this
adds "Ada.Text_Io."  to the line:

         Ada.Text_Io.Put_Line ("hello from hello.adb");

   Now invoke 'Ada | Build | Show main'; this displays 'Ada mode main:
hello'.

   Now (in buffer 'hello.adb'), invoke 'Ada | Build | Build'.  You are
prompted to save the file (if you haven't already).  Then the
compilation buffer is displayed again, containing:

     -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "c:/Projects/org.emacs.ada-mode.stephe-1/test/Example_1/" -*-
     Compilation started at Fri Oct 18 20:39:33

     Link
        [link]         hello.adb

     Compilation finished at Fri Oct 18 20:39:34

   The compilation has succeeded without errors; 'hello.exe' now exists
in the same directory as 'hello.adb'.

   Now invoke 'Ada | Build | Run'.  The '*compilation*' buffer is
displayed, containing

     -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "c:/Projects/org.emacs.ada-mode.stephe-1/test/Example_1/" -*-
     Compilation started at Fri Oct 18 20:41:53

     ./hello
     Hello from hello.adb

     Compilation finished at Fri Oct 18 20:41:53

   That completes the first part of this example.

   Now we will compile a multi-file project.  Open the file
'hello_2.adb', invoke 'Ada | Build | Set main and Build'.  This finds an
error in 'hello_pkg.adb':

     hello_pkg.adb:2:08: keyword "body" expected here [see file name]

   This demonstrates that gprbuild finds the files needed by the main
program.  However, it cannot find files in a different directory, unless
you use a GNAT project file to specify the other directories; *note Set
source search path::.

   Invoke 'Ada | Build | Show main'; this displays 'Ada mode main:
hello_2'.

   Move to the error with 'C-x `', and fix the error by adding 'body':

     package body Hello_Pkg is

   Now, while still in 'hello_pkg.adb', invoke 'Ada | Build | Build'.
gprbuild successfully builds 'hello_2'.  This demonstrates that Emacs
has remembered the main file, in the project variable 'main', and used
it for the Build command.

   Finally, again while in 'hello_pkg.adb', invoke 'Ada | Build | Run'.
The '*compilation*' buffer displays 'Hello from hello_pkg.adb'.

   One final point.  If you switch back to buffer 'hello.adb', and
invoke 'Ada | Build | Run', 'hello_2.exe' will be run.  That is because
'main' is still set to 'hello_2', as you can see when you invoke 'Ada |
Build | Show main'.

   There are two ways to change 'main':

  1. Invoke 'Ada | Build | Set main and Build', which sets 'main' to the
     current file.

  2. Invoke 'Ada | Build | Set Project ...', and select a project file
     that specifies 'main'.

4.2.2 Set compiler options
--------------------------

This example illustrates using a gnat project file to set a compiler
option.

   If you have files from 'Example_1' open in Emacs, you should close
them so you don't get confused.  Use menu 'File | Close (current
buffer)'.

   In directory 'Example_2', create these files:

   'hello.adb':

     with Ada.Text_Io;
     procedure Hello
     is begin
        Put_Line("Hello from hello.adb");
     end Hello;

   This is the same as 'hello.adb' from 'Example_1'.  It has two errors;
missing "use Ada.Text_Io;", and no space between 'Put_Line' and its
argument list.

   'hello.gpr':

     project Hello is
        package Compiler is
           for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-gnatyt");
        end Compiler;
     end Hello;

   This tells the GNAT compiler to check for token spacing; in
particular, there must be a space preceding a parenthesis.

   In buffer 'hello.adb', invoke 'Ada | Build | Set main and Build'.
This finds the project file 'hello.gpr', uses it to set the compiler
options, and builds the project.  You should get a '*compilation*'
buffer containing something like (the directory paths will be
different):

     gprbuild -Phello.gpr hello
     Compile
        [Ada]          hello.adb
     hello.adb:4:04: "Put_Line" is not visible
     hello.adb:4:04: non-visible declaration at a-textio.ads:508
     hello.adb:4:04: non-visible declaration at a-textio.ads:498
     hello.adb:4:12: (style) space required
     gprbuild: *** compilation phase failed

   Compare this to the compiler output in *note No project files::; the
compiler-provided default gpr file has been replaced by 'hello.gpr', and
an additional error is reported in 'hello.adb' on line 4.  This shows
that 'hello.gpr' is being used to set the compiler options.

   Use 'C-x`', 'C-c M-`' to fix the errors, then 'Ada | Build | Build'
and 'Ada | Build | Run' to build and run.

4.2.3 Set source search path
----------------------------

In this example, we show how to deal with files in more than one
directory, setting the source search path in the gpr file.

   Create the directory 'Example_3', containing:

   'hello_pkg.ads':

     package Hello_Pkg is
        procedure Say_Hello;
     end Hello_Pkg;

   'hello_pkg.adb':

     with Ada.Text_Io;
     package Hello_Pkg is
        procedure Say_Hello
        is begin
           Ada.Text_Io.Put_Line ("Hello from hello_pkg.adb");
        end Say_Hello;
     end Hello_Pkg;

   These are the same files from example 1; 'hello_pkg.adb' has an error
on line 2.

   'other.gpr':

     project Other is
        for Source_Dirs use (".", "Other");
     end Other;

   In addition, create a directory 'Example_3/Other', containing this
file:

   'Other/hello_3.adb':

     with Hello_Pkg;
     with Ada.Text_Io; use Ada.Text_Io;
     procedure Hello_3
     is begin
        Hello_Pkg.Say_Hello;
        Put_Line ("From hello_3");
     end Hello_3;

   There are no errors in this file.

   In buffer 'hello_3.adb', invoke 'Ada | Project files | Find and
select project...', and select 'Example_3/other.gpr'.  This tells Emacs
Ada mode to stop using the project file from 'Example_2', and use the
one for 'Example_3'.  Also note that since this project file is not
named 'hello_3.gpr', it would not be found by default.

   Then, again in 'hello_3.adb', invoke 'Ada | Set main and Build'.  You
should get a '*compilation*' buffer containing something like (the
directory paths will be different):

     gprbuild -Pother.gpr hello_3
     Compile
        [Ada]          hello_3.adb
        [Ada]          hello_pkg.adb
     hello_pkg.adb:2:08: keyword "body" expected here [see file name]
     gprbuild: "C:\Examples\Example_3\hello_pkg.adb" compilation error

   Move to the error with 'C-x `'.  Ada mode searches the list of
directories given by 'Source_Dirs' for the file mentioned in the
compiler error message.

   Use 'C-x`', 'C-c M-`' to fix the errors, then 'Ada | Build | Build'
and 'Ada | Build | Run' to build and run.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Use wisi project file,  Next: Use multiple GNAT project files,  Prev: Set source search path,  Up: Compiling Examples

4.2.4 Use wisi project file
---------------------------

In this example, we show how to use a wisi project file to set some
options that cannot be set in a gpr project file.  In addition, we
change a setting so you are prompted for a project file, rather than
using a default one.

   Change the setting:

     M-x set-variable ada-build-prompt-prj search-prompt

   Create the directory 'Example_4', containing:

   'hello_pkg.ads':

     package Hello_Pkg is
        procedure Say_Hello;
     end Hello_Pkg;

   'hello_pkg.adb':

     with Ada.Text_Io;
     package body Hello_Pkg is
        procedure Say_Hello
        is begin
           Put_Line ("Hello from hello_pkg.adb");
        end Say_Hello;
     end Hello_Pkg;

   These two files are the similar to files from example 1;
'hello_pkg.adb' has an error on line 5 (missing "Ada.Text_IO.").

   'example_4.prj':

     -- Wisi project file

     gpr_project_path=More

     gpr_file=example_4.gpr

     casing=example_4.casing

   'example_4.prj' is a wisi project file; it specifies the
'gpr_project_path', telling 'gprbuild' where to search for gpr files,
and specifies the gpr file to use.  Finally it specifies a casing
exception file:

   'example_4.casing':

     Text_IO

   The default auto casing rules in ada-mode state that the Ada package
"Ada.Text_IO" should be capitalized as "Ada.Text_Io", which does not
match the Ada Reference Manual.  'example_4.casing' specifies that
instead "Text_IO" should be capitalized as shown.

   You can create a casing exception by editing the file directly, or
via the 'Ada | Casing' menu.

   'gpr_project_path' and 'casing' are list variables; each occurence in
a wisi project file adds an entry to the list.

   In addition, create a directory 'Example_4/More', containing these
files:

   'more/hello_4.adb':

     with Hello_Pkg;
     with Ada.Text_Io; use Ada.Text_Io;
     procedure Hello_4
     is begin
        Hello_Pkg.Say_Hello;
        Put_Line ("From hello_4");
     end Hello_4;

   There are no errors in this file, except for the casing in
"Ada.Text_Io".

   'More/example_4.gpr':

     project Example_4 is
        for Source_Dirs use (".", "..");

        package Compiler is
           for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-gnatyknpr");
        end Compiler;
     end Example_4;

   The compiler switch checks all casing; we will get errors for
"Ada.Text_Io".

   Then, in 'hello_4.adb', invoke 'Ada | Set main and Build'.  ada-mode
looks for a project file 'hello_4.prj' or 'hello_4.gpr'; since neither
is found, you are prompted to find a project file.  Select
'Example_4/example_4.prj'; that is parsed and selected, and the build
continues.

   You should get a '*compilation*' buffer containing something like
(the directory paths will be different):

     gprbuild -Pexample_4.gpr hello_4
     Compile
        [Ada]          hello_pkg.adb
     hello_pkg.adb:1:16: (style) bad casing of "Text_IO" declared at a-textio.ads:57
     hello_pkg.adb:5:07: "Put_Line" is not visible
     hello_pkg.adb:5:07: non-visible declaration at a-textio.ads:508
     hello_pkg.adb:5:07: non-visible declaration at a-textio.ads:498
     gprbuild: *** compilation phase failed

   When you fix the errors, note that 'C-c M-`' inserts the correct case
for "Ada.Text_IO", and corrects the case where it is incorrect.  The
case is also corrected as you type; you can type "ada.text_io."  and the
case will be corrected when you type each "."  or "_".


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Use multiple GNAT project files,  Next: Use a Makefile,  Prev: Use wisi project file,  Up: Compiling Examples

4.2.5 Use multiple GNAT project files
-------------------------------------

In this example, we show how to use multiple GNAT project files,
specifying the GNAT project search path in an Ada mode project file.
This also requires explicitly setting 'project-find-functions'.

   If you haven't already, create the directory 'Example_4' as specified
in *note Use wisi project file::.  If you've already created it and run
the tutorial, restore the compilation error in hello_pkg.adb; delete
'Ada.Text_IO.' in front of 'Put_Line'.

   Create the directory 'Example_5', containing:

   'hello_5.adb':

     with Hello_Pkg;
     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     procedure Hello_5
     is begin
        Hello_Pkg.Say_Hello;
        Put_Line ("From hello_5");
     end Hello_5;

   There are no errors in this file.

   'hello_5.prj':

     gpr_project_path=../Example_4/More
     gpr_file=hello_5.gpr

     casing=../Example_4/example_4.casing

   'hello_5.gpr':

     with "example_4";
     project Hello_5 is
        for Source_Dirs use (".");
        package Compiler is
           for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-g", "-gnatyknprt");
        end Compiler;
     end Hello_5;

   In buffer 'hello_5.adb', invoke 'Ada | Project | Find and select
project...', and select 'Example_5/hello_5.prj'.  This would also be
found by default if no previous project file had been selected.  Note
that if 'example_5.gpr' were named 'hello_5.gpr', the project file
search would find more than one match, causing an error.

   Then, again in 'hello_5.adb', invoke 'Ada | Build | Set main and
Build'.  You should get a '*compilation*' buffer containing something
like (the directory paths will be different):

     -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: "c:/Projects/org.emacs.ada-mode/test/Example_5/" -*-
     Compilation started at Mon Oct 21 11:32:05

     gprbuild -Pexample_5.gpr hello_5
     Compile
        [Ada]          hello_5.adb
        [Ada]          hello_pkg.adb
     hello_pkg.adb:5:07: "Put_Line" is not visible
     hello_pkg.adb:5:07: non-visible declaration at a-textio.ads:508
     hello_pkg.adb:5:07: non-visible declaration at a-textio.ads:498
     gprbuild: *** compilation phase failed

   Now type 'C-x `'; 'Example_4/hello_pkg.adb' is shown, demonstrating
that 'hello_5.gpr' and 'hello_4.gpr' are being used to set the
compilation search path.

   Now, in buffer 'hello_pkg.adb' invoke the menu 'Ada | Navigate | Find
file in project' (which calls 'ada-find-file') to get back to the
'hello_5.adb' buffer.  If you have not selected any project files
previously in this emacs session, this gives an unexpected prompt for a
"project directory".  Kill that with 'C-g'.  Otherwise, enter 'hel <tab>
5 <tab>'; it will say "no match".

   The problem here the way Emacs projects work.  To find the current
project, the functions in 'project-find-functions' are run; one should
return a project.  The ada-mode build functions add
'wisi-prj-find-dominating-cached' to 'project-find-functions'; that
looks in the current directory tree for a project file with the same
name as one that was previously selected.

   If 'Example_5' is the only project in the current emacs session,
'wisi-prj-find-dominating-cached' finds no project file (because
'Example_4' is not a child directory of 'Example_5'), so the default
strategy of "ask the user" is used, giving the prompt for a directory.

   If 'Example_4' is also a project in the current emacs session,
'wisi-prj-find-dominating-cached' finds that; since it does not contain
'hello_5.adb', 'ada-find-file' cannot find it.

   Any time you have a main project that depends on other projects that
are not in the same directory tree, you will have this problem.

   The fix is to use a different function in 'project-find-functions';
'wisi-prj-current-cached'.  This uses a global variable to indicate what
the current project is.  wisi provides four different functions for
'project-find-functions'.  *Note Selecting projects: (wisi)Selecting
projects.

   To change 'project-find-functions', execute:

     M-: (remove-hook 'project-find-functions 'wisi-prj-find-dominating-cached)
     M-: (add-hook 'project-find-functions 'wisi-prj-current-cached)

   Normally, you must set 'project-find-functions' in your '~/.emacs',
using the 'add-hook' function.  The ada-mode Build menu functions set it
for you to make things simpler for novices, but they do not change it if
you have put one of the wisi functions on it.

   Now set the current project; invoke 'Ada | Project | Find and select
project...', and select 'Example_5/hello_5.prj'.  Then in
'hello_pkg.adb', invoke 'Ada | Navigate | Find file in project'; now we
can find 'hello_5.adb'.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Use a Makefile,  Prev: Use multiple GNAT project files,  Up: Compiling Examples

4.2.6 Use a Makefile
--------------------

In this example, we show how to use a Makefile to build an Ada project
with GNAT, run the result, and clean the build directories.

   Create the directories 'Example_4, Example_5' as specified in *note
Use wisi project file::, *note Use multiple GNAT project files::.

   In 'Example_5', add the file:

   'Makefile':

     # build and run hello_5 project

     all : build run

     .PHONY : force

     build : force
             gprbuild -PExample_5.gpr hello_5

     run :
             ./hello_5

     clean :
             gnatclean -r -PExample_5

     # Local Variables:
     # eval:(unless (wisi-prj-find-function-set-p)(add-hook 'project-find-functions 'wisi-prj-current-cached))
     # eval:(wisi-prj-dtrt-parse-file "hello_5.prj" (ada-prj-default "hello_5 # main") "Makefile")
     # End:

   Tell Emacs to allow 'eval' in 'Local Variables':
     M-: (setq enable-local-eval t)

   Close and re-open 'Makefile'; the 'Local Variables' section sets the
project file to 'hello_5.prj' when the 'Makefile' is opened.

   If you have set 'project-find-functions' in your '~/.emacs', you can
leave out the first 'eval' line.  Note that 'wisi-prj-dtrt-parse-file'
does the right thing depending on which wisi function is in
'project-find-functions'.

   In 'Makefile', invoke 'Tools | Compile...', and accept the default
make command.  This runs the 'all' target, which builds 'hello_5' and
runs it (you may have to fix source errors first, depending on how fresh
the Example_4 directory is).

4.3 Compiler errors
===================

The 'Check syntax' and 'Build' commands, or running 'make', place
compilation errors in a separate buffer named '*compilation*'.

   Each line in this buffer will become active: you can simply click on
it with the middle button of the mouse, or move point to it and press
<RET>.  Emacs will then display the relevant source file and put point
on the line and column where the error was found.

   You can also press the 'C-x `' key ('next-error'), and Emacs will
jump to the first error.  If you press that key again, it will move you
to the second error, and so on.

   Some error messages also include references to other files.  These
references are accessed via 'C-c `'.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Project files,  Next: Moving Through Ada Code,  Prev: Compiling Executing,  Up: Top

5 Project files
***************

Ada mode uses wisi project files; *note Project files: (wisi)wisi.

   A wisi project file specifies what directories hold sources for your
project, and allows you to customize the compilation commands and other
things on a per-project basis.

   The default file extension for wisi project files is '*.adp' or
'*.prj'.  You can use a different extension by adding it to
'ada-prj-file-extensions', and a different syntax by adding a parser
function to 'ada-prj-parser-alist'.

   Note that wisi project files are different than GNAT compiler project
files ('*.gpr').  However, Emacs Ada mode can use a GNAT project file to
specify the project directories.  If no other customization is needed, a
GNAT project file can be used without a wisi project file.

   If no wisi project file is specified, some Ada mode functions are not
available.

5.1 Project file overview
=========================

The current project file is shown by the menu command <Ada | Project
Files | Show project>.

   To set the project file, use the menu command <Ada | Project Files |
Find and select Project ...>, or one of the elisp functions described in
*note Selecting Projects: (wisi)wisi.

   The project file may also be a GNAT project file (with file extension
is '.gpr').


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Project file variables,  Prev: Project file overview,  Up: Project files

5.2 Project file variables
==========================

Some project variables have defaults that can be changed by setting
elisp variables; the table below identifies the elisp variable for each
project variable.  Elisp variables corresponding to project variables
that are lists are elisp lists.

   wisi defines some project variables, Ada mode defines some, others
are defined by the compiler and the cross reference tool.

   Here is the list of variables valid defined by wisi and Ada mode.  In
the default values, the current directory '"."' is the directory
containing the project file.

'ada_compiler' [default: 'ada-compiler, gnat']
     Ada compiler for this project.

     Setting this in the project file reinitializes all options for the
     xref tool, so it must occur before any compiler-specific project
     variable.

'casing'
     List of files containing casing exceptions.  *Note Automatic
     casing: Automatic casing.

'gnat-stub-args'
     List of strings passed to 'gnat stub' when it is run.

'gnat-stub-cargs'
     List of strings passed to 'gnat stub' after '-cargs'.

'obj_dir'
     A list of directories to search for object and cross-reference
     files.  Only needed if you are not using GPR files.

'src_dir'
     A list of directories to search for source files.  Added to the
     source directories from a gpr file (if any).

'xref_tool' [default: 'ada-xref-tool']
     Cross reference tool for this project.

     Setting this in the project file reinitializes all options for the
     xref tool, so it must occur in the project file before any other
     settings that affect the xref tool.

     If 'gpr_query' is found in 'PATH', 'ada-xref-tool' defaults to
     ''gpr_query'.  Otherwise, it defaults to ''gnat', which uses 'gnat
     find'.

   The following project file variables are defined by the GNAT
compiler:

'ada_project_path' [default: ]
     Same as 'gpr_project_path'; see below.

'gpr_file' [default: ]
     The GNAT project file for the project.

     If set, the source and project directories specified in the GNAT
     project file are appended to 'src_dir' and 'gpr_project_path'.
     This allows specifying Ada source directories with a GNAT project
     file, and other source directories with the Emacs project file.

'gpr_project_path' [default: ]
     A list of directories to search for GNAT project files.  The list
     is passed to tools via the 'GPR_PROJECT_PATH' process environment
     variable in the process used to run the 'gnat' and 'gpr_query'
     tools.

     If not set, 'GPR_PROJECT_PATH' in the child process is inherited
     from the Emacs process.

'runtime' [default: ]
     If set, the name of the runtime, used as the value of the 'RTS'
     command line option for tools.

'target' [default: 'nil']
     If set, the name of the cross-compilation target, prepended to the
     'gnat' executable name.

   The following project variables are used by the 'Ada | Build' menu
commands:

'check_cmd' [default: 'ada-build-check-cmd']
     Compiler commannd to syntax check a single file.

'main' [default: basename of current file name]
     File name of executable to build.

6 Moving Through Ada Code
*************************

There are several commands to navigate through Ada code.  All these
functions are available through the Ada menu and keybindings.

   Some of these commands rely on cross reference facilities provided by
the compiler; the standard Emacs Ada mode only supports the GNAT
compiler, but others can be added (*note Other cross-reference::).

'C-c C-d'
     Move from any use of an identifier to its declaration, for from a
     declaration to its body (if there is one).

     This runs 'xref-find-definitions', which has a default global
     binding of <M-.>

'C-c M-d'
     Move from a child type declaration to the parent type declaration;
     display a list of references if there is more than one parent.

'C-c C-n'
     Move to the next keyword in the current statement.

     For example, if point is on 'if', move to 'then'.

     This runs 'forward-sexp', which has a default global binding of
     'C-M-f'.

'C-c C-p'
     Move to the previous keyword in the current statement.

     For example, if point is on 'then', move to 'if'.

     This runs 'backward-sexp', which has a default global binding of
     'C-M-b'.

'C-c C-o'
     Switch between corresponding spec and body.  There are several
     special cases:

        * If the region is active, it is assumed to contain an Ada
          package name; position point on the corresponding package
          declaration.

        * If point is in the start line of a top level child package
          declaration (but not package body), or a child subprogram spec
          or body, position point on the corresponding parent package
          declaration.

        * If point is in the start line of a top level separate body,
          position point on the corresponding separate stub declaration.

        * If point is in a subprogram declaration or body, position
          point on the corresponding body or declaration in the other
          file.

        * If point is on a 'with' clause, position point on the
          corresponding declaration.

'C-c C-r'
     Show all references to the identifier surrounding point.  Use 'C-x
     `' ('next-error') to visit each reference (as for compilation
     errors).

'C-c C-x'
     Show all declarations that override the primitive procedure at
     point.  Use 'C-x `' ('next-error') to visit each reference (as for
     compilation errors).

'C-c M-x'
     Show the declaration that the declaration at point overrides.

'C-u SPACE'
     Jump back to the previous location.

'Ada | Misc | Refresh cross reference cache'
     Cross reference information is loaded from the compiler output when
     the first cross reference command is issued (or when the project
     file is parsed, if useing cached project files).  If the code is
     recompiled after that, the cross reference information is reloaded
     by invoking this menu command.

7 Identifier completion
***********************

Emacs provides two general ways of completing identifiers while typing:
'M-/' (bound to 'dabbrev-expand'), and 'M-tab' (bound to
'complete-symbol'.

   This is an easy way to type faster: you just have to type the first
few letters of an identifier, and then loop through all the possible
completions.

   'complete-symbol' completes on all the symbols defined in the current
project, as returned by 'gpr_query'.  For a procedure declared as:

     package Package_Name is
        procedure Procedure_Name (args);

   the completion string looks like:

     Procedure_Name(args)<Package_Name<line>>

   so for example you can type "iterate<wisitok" to complete on
WisiToken iterators, or "add(Data" to complete on all subprograms whose
name starts with "add" and whose first argument starts with "Data".

   If you have bound 'hippie-expand', that also uses 'dabbrev-expand'.

   'dabbrev-expand' completes on all words in all open Ada files for
possible completions, using simple Emacs syntax-class parsing.

   For instance, if the words 'my_identifier' and 'my_subprogram' are
the only words starting with 'my' in any of the open Ada files, then you
will have this scenario:

     You type:  myM-/
     Emacs inserts:  'my_identifier'
     If you press M-/ once again, Emacs replaces 'my_identifier' with
     'my_subprogram'.
     Pressing M-/ once more will bring you back to 'my_identifier'.

   This is a very fast way to do completion, and the casing of words
will also be respected.

   Another place where identifier completion is used in the
'xref-find-definitions' (<C-u M-.>) and 'wisi-goto-spec/body' (<C-u C-c
C-d>) commands; these complete on all symbols in the project (provided
by 'gpr_query').  With two 'C-u', the completion is limited to symbols
defined in the current file.

   Note that in Ada, for subprograms that have a specification in the
'.ads' file and a body in the '.adb' file, <C-u C-u C-c C-d> returns the
spec location only, so it will not find the function if invoked in the
'.adb' file.

8 Indentation
*************

Ada mode comes with a full set of rules for automatic indentation.  You
can also configure the indentation, via the following variables:

'ada-indent' (default value: 3)
     Number of columns for default indentation.

'ada-indent-after-trailing-comment' (default value t)
     If t, align comment lines imediately following a comment on the
     same line as code with the preceding comment.  Otherwise, ignore
     the preceding comment.

'ada-indent-broken' (default value: 2)
     Number of columns to indent the continuation of a broken line.

'ada-indent-comment-col-0' (default value: nil)
     If non-nil, comments currently starting in column 0 are left in
     column 0.  Otherwise, they are indented with previous comments or
     code.

'ada-indent-comment-gnat' (default value: nil)
     If non-nil, comments are indented to meet the GNAT style check; one
     of:
        * multiple of 'ada-indent'
        * next non-blank line
        * previous non-blank line

     Otherwise, they are indented with previous comments or code.

'ada-indent-label' (default value: -3)
     Number of columns to indent a label.

'ada-indent-record-rel-type' (default value: 3)
     Indentation for 'record' relative to 'type' or 'use'.

'ada-indent-renames' (default value: 2)
     Indentation for 'renames' relative to the matching subprogram
     keyword.

     If the subprogram has parameters then if 'ada-indent-renames' is
     zero or less the indentation is abs 'ada-indent-renames' relative
     to the open parenthesis; if 'ada-indent-renames' is one or more the
     indentation is relative to the line containing the keyword.

     If the subprogram has no parameters then 'ada-indent-broken' the
     indentation is relative to the indentation of the line containing
     the keyword.

'ada-indent-return' (default value: 0)
     Indentation for 'return' relative to the matching 'function'.

     If the function has parameters, then if 'ada-indent-return' is zero
     or less the indentation is abs 'ada-indent-return' relative to the
     open parenthesis; if 'ada-indent-return' is one or more,
     indentation is relative to line containing 'function'.

     If the function has no parameters, 'ada-indent-broken' is used
     relative to line containing 'function'.

'ada-indent-use' (default value: ada-indent-broken)
     Indentation for the lines in a 'use' statement.

'ada-indent-when' (default value: 3)
     Indentation for 'when' relative to 'exception', 'case', or 'or' in
     'select'.

'ada-indent-with' (default value: ada-indent-broken)
     Indentation for the lines in a 'with' context clause.

   The indentation variables are buffer local; the global value may be
overridden in an elisp function on 'ada-mode-hook', or in a file local
variable section.

   The following keys indent portions of the text:

'RET'
     Insert and indent a new line.

'TAB'
     Indent the current line, or the current region.

'C-c TAB'
     Indent the current statement or declaration.

'C-c S-TAB'
     Indent the statement or declaration containing the current
     statement or declaration.

   The indentation algorithm relies on a grammar parser to identify the
syntactic role for keywords and other words in the code.

   In rare cases, the parser gets confused; it can be reset by invoking
menu <Ada | Misc | Restart parser>.  Please report such cases as a bug.


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Statement skeletons,  Next: Aligning code,  Prev: Indentation,  Up: Top

9 Statement skeletons
*********************

'C-c C-e' expands the previous one or two words into a statement
skeleton.  For example, 'i f C-c C-e' expands to:

     if  then
     elsif  then
     else
     end if;

   For named statements (packages, loops, etc), the name is taken from
the word before point, and the name of the statement from the word
before that.

   Some expansions prompt for more information, such as whether a spec
or body is desired.  For example, 'package A_Package C-c C-e' first
prompts for "body" or "spec".  If "spec" is selected, the following code
is inserted:

     package A_Package is
     private
     end A_Package;

   Named blocks work similarly: 'declare A_Block C-c C-e' expands
(without prompting) to:

     A_Block:
        declare
        begin
        exception
        end A_Block;

   Note that the order of the keyword 'declare' and the name 'A_Block'
are reversed in the expansion; this may take some getting used to.
Alternately, if no name is present in the buffer, you are prompted for a
name: 'declare C-c C-e' first prompts for a name, then expands to the
above.

   The variable 'ada-skel-initial-string' defines what to insert in a
newly created empty buffer.  It defaults to '{header}', which is a
placeholder defined by 'ada-skel-header', which inserts a typical header
with a copyright license (choice of GPL or restricted).  Users will
typically want to override the definition of 'ada-skel-initial-string'
and/or 'ada-skel-header', or provide more choices of copyright license.

10 Aligning code
****************

Aligning code adds space in each line so that similar parts of
successive lines are aligned vertically.  For example, a sequence of
declarations:

     A : Integer;
     Another : Float := 1.0;
     More : Integer := 2;

   changes to this when aligned:

     A       : Integer;
     Another : Float   := 1.0;
     More    : Integer := 2;

   Alignment is invoked by 'C-c C-a', which aligns the sequence of
statements surrounding point, or within the selected region.

   Parameter lists are also aligned:

        procedure Foo
          (A : in Integer;
           Another : out Float := 1.0;
           More : in out Integer := 2);

   is aligned to:

        procedure Foo
          (A       : in     Integer;
           Another :    out Float   := 1.0;
           More    : in out Integer := 2);


File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Automatic casing,  Next: Comment Handling,  Prev: Aligning code,  Up: Top

11 Automatic casing
*******************

Casing of identifiers, attributes and keywords is automatically
performed while typing when the variable 'ada-auto-case' is non-nil (the
default).  Every time you type a word separator, the previous word is
automatically cased.

   You can customize the automatic casing with the following variables:

'ada-case-keyword'
     Value must be one of:
     'downcase-word'
          Ada keywords will be lowercase.

     'upcase-word'
          Ada keywords will be uppercase.

'ada-case-strict'
     If non-nil, all identifiers are forced to 'Mixed_Case'; first
     letter, and letter following "_" are uppercase; rest are lowercase.

     If nil, the mixed case characters in identifiers are forced to
     upper case, but the other characters are not modified.  That allows
     typing all uppercase identifiers without defining a casing
     exception.

   You can define exceptions to these rules, in files specified by the
'casing' project variable; *note Casing exception files: (wisi)Casing
exception files.

   There are two ways to add new items to a casing exception file: you
can simply edit it as you would edit any text file, or you can position
point on the word you want to add, and select menu 'Ada | Casing |
Create full exception' or 'Ada | Casing | Create partial exception'.
The word will be added to the current list of exceptions and to the
file.

   It is sometimes useful to have multiple exception files.  For
example, one could be the standard Ada acronyms, the second some company
specific exceptions, and the last one some project specific exceptions.
When you create a new exception, you are prompted for the file to save
it in.

   Other keys and menu entries are defined:

'C-c C-w'
     Adjust case of the word at point.  With prefix arg, adjust case
     even if in a comment or string.  Normally, comments and strings are
     not affected by case adjust.

'Ada | Casing | Adjust case region'
     Adjust case in the active region.

'Ada | Casing | Adjust case buffer'
     Adjust case in the active buffer.

12 Comment Handling
*******************

By default, comment lines get indented like Ada code.  There are a few
additional functions to handle comments:

'M-;'
     If the region is active, comment or uncomment it.

     If the current line is empty, start a comment.

     Otherwise, add a comment at the end of the line, in a column given
     by 'comment-column'.

'M-q'
     Fill the current comment paragraph.

File: ada-mode.info,  Node: Directory structure,  Next: ELPA,  Up: Developer overview

14.1 Directory structure
========================

'org.emacs.ada-mode'
     Main source.

     File extensions:
     '*.el'
          Elisp files; main code.

     '*.elc'
          Byte-compiled elisp files, not in the distribution.  Generated
          by the Makefile target 'byte-compile', or by the Emacs package
          installer.

     '*.ad?'
          Ada code for the external process parser, some generated by
          the WisiToken tool 'wisitoken-bnf-generate.exe'.  The
          generated code is in the tarball distribution and the monotone
          repository so users and Elisp developers don't have to install
          WisiToken.

     '*.parse_table'
          Diagnostic output from 'wisitoken-bnf-generate.exe', useful
          for tracing parses while debugging a grammar issue.  Not in
          the tarball distribution or the monotone repository.

     '*.wy'
          Grammar files, specifying the language to be parsed.  The
          syntax for these grammar files is similar to that for bison
          and wisent, but not the same; see the WisiToken documentation
          for more info.

     '*.texi'
          Texinfo source for the user guides.

     '*.html'
          Generated user guide in HTML format.

     '*.info'
          Generated user guide in Emacs info format.

'build'
     Makefile for building the external process executable, gpr-query,
     and the user guides; for running tests; and for publishing to the
     web page or Gnu ELPA. The main targets are:

     'elisp'
          Builds ada-mode in place, runs all tests.

     'update-elisp'
          Builds ada-mode in place.

     'install'
          Installs executables in the GNAT executable directory.

     'pub'
          Builds the ELPA packages.

'test'
     All tests for Ada mode, gpr mode, parser.

     Each test is run in a separate invocation of Emacs, so it is
     completely independent of all other tests.

     The tests are driven by the elisp code in
     'wisi-run-indent-test.el'.

     In general, the Ada mode tests open the file, execute test actions,
     re-indent, and re-captialize the entire file.  The result is diffed
     with the original, and must match.

     The test actions are defined by comments with the prefix
     '--EMACSCMD:'; they are elisp forms that invoke Ada mode functions.
     This is used to test navigation features and other parser effects.

'test/Example_*'
     Starting files for the examples in this user guide.

'test/gpr'
     Tests for gpr mode.

'test/subdir'
     More tests; allows testing path search features.

14.2 ELPA
=========

Ada mode is published via the Gnu ELPA archive.  To test a new version
of Ada mode, we use a local Gnu ELPA archive.  That requires fetching
Gnu ELPA via git:

     cd /Projects
     git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/elpa.git

   If you have an Emacs Savannah developer account, you can use:

     cd /Projects
     git clone <login>@git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/elpa.git

   'build/Makefile' contains targets for copying Ada mode source to the
elpa workspace, and for building the elpa archive there.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
